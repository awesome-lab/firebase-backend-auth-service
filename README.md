## More Info ‚ÑπÔ∏è

1¬∞) Use **signInWithPassword** to log in at initial stage

```bash
curl 'https://identitytoolkit.googleapis.com/v1/accounts:signInWithPassword?key=[API_KEY]' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-binary '{"email":"[user@example.com]","password":"[PASSWORD]","returnSecureToken":true}'
```

2¬∞) Store the credentials into a backend service such as (node-persist, redis, etc.)

3¬∞) use the **refreshToken** to get a new token with the following command

```bash
curl 'https://securetoken.googleapis.com/v1/token?key=[API_KEY]' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data 'grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=[REFRESH_TOKEN]'
```

## Other üöß

**IMPORTANT**: The refresh token is valid for 1 hour, so you need to store it in a backend service and refresh it every hour.

**DO NOT** call **signInWithPassword** endpoint for each request, spaming will get you a quota error limit.

**DO NOT** use the auth code into the browser or any direct front-end solution, it's only for the server side. You'll risk to expose your personnal credentials such as email, password and API_KEY.
